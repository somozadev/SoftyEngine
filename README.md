# **Softy Engine ðŸŽ®ðŸš€**

<br />
Softy Engine is a lightweight basic ECS based physics engine built using C# and SFML, designed to provide hands-on experience in real-time physics and ECS programming.

## ðŸ›  Features
<br />
Rigidbodies
Softbodies
ECS architecture
Collisions between softbodies
Collisions between circle rigidbodies
<br /><br />

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
<br />
Prerequisites
<br />
.NET 8.0 or higher <br />
<br /><br />
Installation
<br />
git clone https://github.com/somozadev/Graphics.git<br />
cd  SoftyEngine\bin\Debug\net8.0\SoftyEngine.exe to test <br />
<br /><br />

## ðŸŽ® Controls
<br />
Mouse 1: Adds force to nearby actors <br />
Mouse 2: Instantiates selected body type and shape <br />
Space: Change between rigidbody and softbody for instantiation <br />
Control: Change between circle, square, triangle and polygon shapes for instantiation <br />
R: <br />
<br /><br />

## ðŸ–¼ TODO List
<br />
 Implement collisions for rigidbodies other than circles<br />
 Collisions between soft and rigid bodies<br />
 Improve inner lock / crazy inertia in softbodies when too much force applied to a point <br />
